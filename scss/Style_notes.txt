//==||---------------||==\\

// This section talks on the rules for styling for the SCSS. //
//   Please make sure to follow these as much as possible.   //


//** File Order **//

*   The order of the file should go:
        -   Title header
        -   Page notes
        -   Imports
        -   Variables (where applicable)
        -   Mixins (where applicable)
        -   Functions (where applicable)
        -   Style sections (in DOM order)
        -   Logs (where applicable)


//** Sections **//

*   Each SCSS file should start with a header, for quick identification.
            //==||----------||==\\
            //==||----------||==\\
            //==||----------||==\\
    The title should be on the second line, and should be as centred as possible.
    Exceptions: Style_notes, style.scss

*   If there are any notes for the whole page, these should come next.
    They should be headed with this:
            //--> NOTES |
    The notes should be contained within this:
            // * 'Note goes here' |

*   Any main section after this should be headed with this:
            //--|| Title ||----------------------
    And ended with this:
            //-----------------------------------
    These should always take up the same amount of characters. Add or remove
    dashes from end to fit. Each section should be separated by a double-space.

*   Sub-sections should be headed with:
            // Title
    And ended with:
            //--
    Each sub-section should be separated by a single-space.

*   Each section and sub-section should be arranged in DOM order.


//** Selectors **//

*   Selectors should appear in DOM order, where possible.

*   Nested selectors should not go more than two deep.

*   Nested selectors and properties should go in this order, where possible:
    -   Properties unrelated to media query changes
    -   Nested selector properties unrelated to media query changes
    -   Pseudo-classes / elements unrelated to media query changes
    -   Properties that will change with media queries
    -   Nested selector properties that will change with media queries
    -   Pseudo-classes / elements that will change with media queries
    -   Non-size-related media queries, with non-nested before nested, before pseudos
    -   Size-related media queries in size order, with non-nested before nested,
        before pseudos

*   Each nested selector that takes up more than two lines should be
    preceded and followed by a blank line.

*   Where these orders cannot be followed, a '//OOO//' note should be made next
    to it, along with a note on why.


//** Properties **//

*   Where possible, properties within each section of the order above should
    follow this order:
    -   Display properties
    -   Position properties
    -   Z-Index
    -   Overflow
    -   Box-model properties, including margin and padding
    -   Background properties
    -   Border properties
    -   Text properties
    -   Cursor property
    -   Other

*   Each time a variable, mixin or function is used, a note with the file it comes
    from should come after it.

*   There should be a single space between the property and the value / keyword.


//** Notes **//

*   Each time properties which will change with media queries are presented, a 
    '#(m)#' note should be put above them.

*   Notes which explain what multiple lines of code are (or do) should be made
    above the lines in this format:
            //- Note goes here -
    When the lines of code are finished, they should be followed up with a notes
    in this format:
            //-/

*   A single-line comment should be made in this format:
            //--> Note goes here

*   Notes to show a piece of code that is experimental should be in this format:
            //--!! Note goes here


//** Logs **//

*   A log should be made for each variable, mixin, function, and the '#(m)#'
    note. These should be made on the corresponding file in which they are
    defined.

*   They log should be headed in this format:
            //--|| 'Title' Log ||----------------
    And should be followed with this:
            //-----------------------------------
    These should always contain the same amount of characters. Add or remove
    dashes from end to fit.

*   They log should be made in this format: 
            //  *** file_name.scss 
            //      *   selector containing nested selector with rule
            //          **   nested selector containing rule (line#)
            //  *** next_file_name.scss
            //      **  selector containing rule
            //          **   nested selector also containing rule (line#)
